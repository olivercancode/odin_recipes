    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Basic recipes online will instruct you to use little more than just soy sauce
         and sugar. It takes a little more than that!
    </p>
    <p>
        Getting a little caramelisation on the noodles makes all the difference 
        between an “ok” and “wow, its JUST like you get at restaurants!”.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remove the stir fry ingredients. Cook the noodles with sauce separately. 
        Less stuff in the wok (or skillet) = easier to caramelise the noodles. 
        At least, at home. 
        If you’ve got a giant restaurant wok burner, 
        you don’t need to do the noodles separately!

        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Using either a wok or large skillet set over high heat, 
            heat the oil then sauté the garlic until it goes light golden. 
            Add the chicken then once it mostly changes from pink to white, 
            add the Chinese broccoli stems which take longer to cook than the 
            leafy part. Once the chicken is cooked (it should only take 2 to 3 
            minutes), toss the Chinese broccoli leaves in and cook for 30 seconds 
            or so just until wilted.

            Push everything to the side to make room to scramble the eggs on the
             side. This is the traditional Thai way of scrambling eggs in Pad See Ew!
        </li>
        <li>
            Crack egg straight into the wok.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scramble egg – Then mix to scramble it. Speed is of the essence here – 
            we want scrambled egg not a sunny side up egg!
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the chicken and vegetables onto plate. As mentioned above, 
            the best way to cook Pad See Ew at home is to cook the noodles 
            separately so we can get some nice caramelisation on them. 
            If we don’t do this, then the noodles just stew instead of caramelising.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add noodles and sauce into the wok.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss quickly for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until the sauce is 
            dispersed throughout the noodles and you see some caramelisation 
            on the edges.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the noodles are caramelised, add the chicken and vegetables back in. 
            Give it a quick toss just to disperse, then serve!
        </li>
