    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Pad kra pao literally means "holy basil stir fry," so 
        the holy basil is the key ingredient here. This recipe uses 
        ground beef, but can be made with any kind of protein. 
        Of all Thai stir fries, this is one of the easiest to make, 
        and a great weeknight recipe as minimal prep is required. 
        And it's gluten free!

    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a mortar and pestle, pound the Thai chilies into a fine paste. 
            Add the garlic and the chopped mild chilies and pound just into a 
            rough paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a wok over high heat, then add the beef and spread it out. 
            Sear the beef without moving it until the underside is browned. 
            Toss and keep cooking until liquid from the beef starts to come out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the beef cook, stirring occasionally, 
            until all liquid has evaporated and the beef starts to
             sizzle and brown further to develop flavour. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Push the beef to one side of the pan, add a little more oil 
            and add the garlic and chili mixture, then sauté until garlic 
            starts to turn golden.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss the garlic with the beef then add about half of the stock or water, 
            fish sauce and sugar; toss to mix well.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the julienned mild chilis and toss for 30 seconds; 
            if it’s looking too dry, add a splash more water or stock.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn off the heat, add the basil and mix just until wilted. 
            Taste and adjust seasoning with more sugar or fish sauce as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat about ¼ inch of frying oil to a small nonstick frying pan over 
            medium-high heat. Once hot, add only the egg white and let it fry until 
            the edges start to turn brown, then using a spoon, push the middle of 
            the white down to make an indent for the yolk to sit in. Break any big 
            bubbles that form in the center. (If you want a firmer yolk, simply fry 
            the whole egg.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the egg white is browned around the edges, 
            carefully place the yolk into the indentation on top of the white.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a spoon to baste some oil around the edges of the egg yolk to
             help it stick. Let it cook for a bit longer if you prefer the yolk 
             to be a little bit more set.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a wire skimmer to remove from the pan and allow to drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon pad kra pao over some jasmine rice, and top with the fried egg.
             You can then drizzle the prik nam pla on top of the egg.
        </li>
    </ol>
